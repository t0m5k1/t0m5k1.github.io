# Catch up
In [part 3](https://tomsbox.co.uk/2019/02/Browser-Privacy-3/) I covered my choice of the best browser for privacy, PI-Hole deployment and a good addon to create browser based containers for firefox.

## Latest
Things in browser land have gone totally gaga!
We have a few forks of chromium. One of these is Edge (no links) this is M$ default browser choice and it is chock full of traking that adds to googles default tracking and ties into Win11 telemetry.
In the first days we thought it was gonna be bad but what it is now is just annoying. I'll stop it there and just suggest you use [Chris Titus Winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) to either remove Edge or hoble it !

I still use and recommend [Brave](https://brave.com) however I no longer use the BAT tipping system as I don't use/support crypto.

Another choice is an interesting one.
[The Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/) is developed – in collaboration between Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project – to minimize tracking and fingerprinting. It is a fork of FireFox.
This cheeky little browser has Tor and the mulvad VPN built in along with their other changes to secure it further.

If you want another chromium based browser I'd suggest ungoogled-chromium but I will not be linking to it.

## Further developments
There are other changes afoot in browser land and this is Manifest V3.
Essentially Manifest V3 is a fundamental change in how extensions work in chromium based browsers. In that Google is really fed up with uBlockOrigin stopping most of their wonderful advert tracking and decided to end the game for the extension and others like it.
It is basically limiting what can be externally loaded in size and volume, uBlockOrigin loaded block lists from github and blocked the elements on page load, All that has come to a grinding halt and also due to the infinate wisdom of Mozilla this will also potentially affect FireFox browser, How I'm not exacly sure but there we go.

As a brave user I know their efforts will not be stopped as they've patched there system so damn deep that it's essentially not an extension! Brave have also said that specfic V2 extensions will be available in brave and you will have the ability to load them from a zip or folder in dev mode.

How long this all stays in play and what happens when it all comes into effect in 2025 is anyones guess. I'm kinda hoping a totally new browser pops up but I'm also hoping a 3rd party extension store pops up too.

So that concludes this article.
