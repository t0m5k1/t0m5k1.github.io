This site was originally on a company server owned by my employer. When I left that employer I couldn't really keep it left on their server without paying.
So continuing my small venture of trying to run this website for free I moved it to a host who will remain nameless.
I managed to keep the site with them for about a month before they decided to just redirect to their sales page and use my domain as an advert!

It was at this point it went offline until I found https://freehosting.host/
