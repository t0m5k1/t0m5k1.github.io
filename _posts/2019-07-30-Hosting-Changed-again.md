Well on the 4th July I noticed the following in my inbox:

Dear Thomas Rand,

Due to changes in license fees by cPanel, which will charge a fee for each user and not more per server, all free hosting will be terminated in 30 days.

If you wish to continue with your hosting, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan before 08/may/2019, when free hosting will be terminated, with files and data permanently deleted from our servers.

We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for the time you enjoy our free hosting services.

Best Regards,

https://freehosting.host/


So I then decided to embark on a trip into markdown, ruby and Jekyll via the wonderful place that is Github. 
And here we are!

I hope you like the new home for this humble site of mine.
New features to come and some old ones may change but on the whole I'm liking this new site and the static nature of it lol
